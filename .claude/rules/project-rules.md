# Project Rules

Durable rules for AI dev + code-review agents working on this project. Rules are accumulated from completed epic retrospectives and any other moment where a general pattern is recognized. Each rule captures a reusable lesson, with a short citation of the bug, anti-pattern, or situation that motivated it.

**How rules land here:** every retrospective ends with a "Rules to codify" step. Any lesson with general-pattern shape (would prevent a recurrence of a class of issues in a future epic, not just the specific incident at hand) is added to this file. Narrow one-off fixes stay in the source retro/story document and do NOT become rules.

**Template usage:** this header and Rule #1 (the meta-rule below) are intentionally project-agnostic — they can be dropped into any new project's `.claude/rules/project-rules.md` as the starting template. Subsequent rules (#2 onwards) are project-specific and accumulate from that project's retrospectives.

## 1. Meta-rule — codify retrospective lessons as rules

**Context:** Every completed epic retrospective (and any other moment a reusable lesson is explicitly identified).

**Rule:** At the end of every retrospective, add a "Rules to codify" step. For each lesson with general-pattern shape, append a new rule to this file following the format below. Narrow one-off fixes stay in the retrospective document and do NOT become rules.

**Format per rule:**
- Numbered heading with short title
- `**Context:**` — when the rule applies
- `**Rule:**` — what to do (or not do)
- `**Why:**` — the bug, anti-pattern, or cost that motivated the rule (with commit hash or bug number from the source retro if useful)
- Optional code snippet or example

**Why:** Retrospectives without a codification step produce lessons that age. The next epic then re-learns them the hard way. The value of a retro compounds only when its lessons become durable guidance the next dev/review agent actually sees before making a decision. Story files, commit messages, and retrospective prose do not survive as agent-visible context beyond the session that wrote them — `.claude/rules/*.md` does.

**How to apply:** when closing any retrospective:
1. Review the retrospective's "What could've gone better" and "Lessons learned" sections.
2. For each lesson, ask: *does this prevent a class of future bugs, or is it specific to the one that already happened?*
3. If class-of-bugs → append to this file.
4. Commit the rule file update in the same commit as the retrospective document.

**Cross-project library note:** rules here are project-scoped by default. When multiple projects adopt this system, rules with evidence from 2+ projects can be elevated into a shared library (shared npm package, git submodule, or copy-and-curate sync). Tag rules with `id:` slugs and `scopes:` frontmatter when that cross-project moment arrives so merging is mechanical rather than manual.
